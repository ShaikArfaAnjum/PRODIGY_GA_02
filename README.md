Image Generation using Pre-trained Generative Models (DALL·E-mini / Stable Diffusion)
# Task-02: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

## 📌 Problem Statement
Utilize pre-trained generative models like **DALL·E-mini** or **Stable Diffusion** to create images from **text prompts**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this task is to demonstrate how **pre-trained generative AI models** can be used to convert **natural language text prompts into high-quality images**, without training a model from scratch.  
This task focuses on practical implementation, user interaction, and professional presentation.

---

## 🧠 Overview of the Solution
In this project, a **pre-trained Stable Diffusion model** is used to generate images from text prompts.  
A **Gradio-based front-end interface** is built to allow users to easily interact with the model and generate images in real time.

The entire project is implemented in **Google Colab** using GPU acceleration for efficient image generation.

## 🤖 Model Used
### Stable Diffusion (Pre-trained)
- A state-of-the-art **text-to-image diffusion model**
- Trained on large-scale image–text datasets
- Capable of generating **realistic and artistic images**
- Loaded using the **Diffusers** library from HuggingFace

---

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Google Colab (GPU – T4)**
- **Stable Diffusion (Diffusers Library)**
- **PyTorch**
